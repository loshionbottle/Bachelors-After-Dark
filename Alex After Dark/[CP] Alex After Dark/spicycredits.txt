I swear, the last thank you message I made for one of my packs was a lot easier to type. 
Things seemed more clear-cut and it was apparent how much support I received following the drama in May. 

Now that things have calmed down and people have moved on, there's been a select few people who've stuck around and helped with minor things like helping come up with lines, testing events, making sure my English is up-to-par and not stupid... hell, even people who've stuck around the discord and offered support in less direct ways. And to all of them, I want to say a big fat thank you and BIG SMOOCHES. 

Moving on from drama like that takes a lot, and it was a hell of a lot easier with a great support system behind me. Thank you all.


Nonetheless, there are a few people who I need to personally thank in a bigger, more personal way. 
    - Thank you Caterpixie for sticking around and do all the work you've done for practically nothing. She's helped proof read, come up with dialogue lines, made the Patreon events a hell of a lot more spicy, and overall did so much of the meticulous stuff that I eventually got annoyed with doing. (Like face frames.... omfg...) 
    Dude, seriously, thank you. You've just... been there this entire time. I honestly don't know if I could've continued this series without you and your support. I wish I could give more back to you, that's how much you've impacted me. I love you a lot... big homo.

    - And also... Thank you to density120, museLaSora, and bruhmoment6475 for your also more direct means of helping with dialogue lines, proof-reading ma shit, etc. You're all so fuckin sexy I just UGH *smooches* 

    - THANK YOU DIA FOR CONTINUING TO GIVE ME ART!!! UGH YOUR RENDITIONS OF THE BACHELORS ARE SO SEXY I'M S(CREAMING) 

    - Thank you also to users: Aoi, Tova, Twig, Monstarmews, nekosneko, chatdisabled, and owitchieso for your indirect or direct inspiration on dialogue lines! Your credits are also under the section you helped in the default.json i18n file!
