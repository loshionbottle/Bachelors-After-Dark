Lord... This pack is something for me istg.
First, the "scandal" back in May with the original pack, then AGAIN in like July with it's rerelease. I'm honestly just hoping nothing else happens to this pack and it can stay up.

I know this is a bit cheesy but seriously, thank you to everyone who's even breathed near this pack. 

Special thank you to Caterpixie (fuckin every event istg), BruhMoment, Kana, Shay (The Chapel Event), Denny (The Joja Line in the OG Bathhouse Scene), & LoshSpawn for their ideas and help with events! 
Yeah I'm not feeling sappy enough to write more heart felt words about y'all so this is all you're getting ily <3 

Another special thank you to ghotstee (Mel) for proof reading my shit! Engwish hard.....
And one last thank you to Makenzie for being such a thorough tester and sending me all the shit I did wrong!
