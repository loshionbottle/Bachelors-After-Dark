Although majority of the mod was done by me, Loshionbottle, coming up with 400+ lines of dialogue + events like this is CRAZY to do by yourself and no support.

Nonetheless, I've had amazing support through my discord server: https://discord.gg/spicybachelors 
Seriously, a HUGE thank you to everyone who's answered my polls, filled out forms, given their honest opinions, shared art, their writing, EVERYTHING. 
I love you all and will be forever grateful that the community I've created has turned out so amazing, especially given the 'scandal' that happened about a month prior to this mod's release. 

I want to reiterate how amazing everyone has been to be this past few weeks, and will be memorializing EVERYONE in this .txt file. (Don't worry, this sappy ass shit won't affect your gameplay.)

    -> Special thank you to BruhMoment (or gockMoment, his government name), for giving ideas for the wet dream, the FUCKING SOUND EFFECTS YOU MADE??? HOLY SHIT DUDE THEY TURNED OUT SO GOOD!!!, images for the shadow NPC that was created for this pack, and literally everything else you've done for the server/pack. I greatly appreciate it all, and I hope everyone else will scream from the image and sound effects you've done. You're seriously amazing for doing all of that without expecting much in return. Also, thank you for moaning and breathing in my DMs LMAOO 

    -> HUGE shoutout to caterpixie as well for all ur help coming up and helping with events/dialogue, proof readin my shi, and overall supporting my horniness in everyway that you did!! Also the fact that you stayed silent despite you literally having access to all of my planning materials? AND you never gloated about this fact?? Yoba, you've really allowed me to be able to trust others again, and i just KJLSFHKLSGH LJKLJFHKLJ HLK i love u sm bbg <3 

    -> To those apart of the mod team, thank you for both the silence and the support. You guys seriously knew what I needed when I needed it. I appreciate everything y'all have done for me behind my back and in front of it. It really made me cry hearing what you all did. Thank you. I'll never forget y'all, fr. 

    -> To those who've stayed with me throughout the entire scandal, no matter what position you were in, I love you, seriously, thank you. The amount of support I recieved in DMs was overwhelming, but I made sure to respond to everyone because you deserved it. 

    -> To those who've stayed silent, but offered support through reactions, polls, etc. THANK YOU FOR THE SUPPORT. I LOVED SEEING YOU ALL REACT, AND YES, I SAW EVERY USERNAME WHO DID. 

    -> I want to also give a HUGE shoutout to anyone who wrote suggestions for events on the server as well. Though I didn't explicitly use any real suggestions y'all gave, I was heavily inspired by them all. 

    -> AHHHH Thank you sm to Diachuu for her amazing art used for the thumbnail and the comic based off of the bathhouse (and soon to be chapel??)! GAAAHHH you're so talented I love you!! 

    -> Also, another HUGE shoutout to Loshspawn on the discord though, that 9 heart event you wrote really got my initial horny gears spinning <3

I love you all.
