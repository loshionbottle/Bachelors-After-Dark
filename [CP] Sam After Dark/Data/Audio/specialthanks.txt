Though I've given BruhMoment his due in spicycredits.txt (and also on the site) I wanted to make another one dedicated just to him due to both the dialogue files and your work for the shadow NPC.

It's been hard to really trust someone again after what happened with the last mod, but with you helping and not expecting much in return has made things a lot easier in terms of getting over it and continuing to work on the mod. I really hope everyone loves your work as much as I do, it's really made these events so much more creepy and immersive.

i just AHAHHFHRJKHSFKLHKAJDKJH thank you, for real.
